# Writer
A simple lil UI to help me write the content for my text adventure game. Structures the writing and game outcomes, forces certain inputs, assumes certain defaults, spits everything out in the expected data structure that that the game engine takes in.

## Plans
Brain roadmap includes 
- colors/edges to show links between options and next screens within an event
- colors/edges to show links between events
- perhaps a whole tree/node based visualizations with above and more for events (either interactive or as a simple render output)
- animations to make things pleasing
